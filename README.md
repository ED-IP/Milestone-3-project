# Tech-Tionary 

TECH-TiONARY is dictionay dedicated to store Computer Science and tech terms.
The objective of the site is to have short definitions of common terms used in the field of computer since and technology but without giving a full explain of the term in question, for example for terms related to coding it will not provide examples of use.

The target user is those that want a quick summary of some term/words that they could have read in more in detail documentation or around the web.
Also it is possible for guest to register in the website adquiring the ability of add/edit/delete entrys to the dictionary (with some limitations for the last two options).
