# Milestone 3 (Description)

A simple app to manage the Book catalog from a shop
 
## UX

All of this is outdated (no longer in the scope of the project)

As the owner of the website I want:
- That any guest can search for terms
- If a guest do a search without success I want to show them an error message
- That registred users could add new entrys to the dictionary
- That registred users could edit or delete only their own entrys
- To register an user a guest need to provide a username, email address and password
- An Administrator user that could edit and delete any entry on the dictionary

As user of the website:
- I want to be able to search terms and see their definition
- I want to have the ability to add new entrys to the dictionary
- I want the possibility of edit or delete entrys
- I want to be able to update my information (e-mail)
